            domain  => 'com.mycorp.myapp',
        });

        my $config = $plconfig_userconfig->load();

        # Global configuration.

        my $plconfig_globalconfig = Config::PlConfig->new({

DESCRIPTION
    This is a prototype for a configuration system in Perl. It is meant to
    be inspired by the gconf and Apple Property List configuration systems.

    The name, API and features of this module is most likely to change in
    the near future so it's not meant to be used for production systems.

    If you'd like to help develop a configuration system for Perl, you are
    very welcome.

WHERE DOES IT SAVE CONFIGURATION FILES?
  LOCAL CONFIGURATION
    Local configuration files will be stored in the data directory of the
    users home directory.

    File::HomeDirs "my_data" method is used to find the data directory.

  GLOBAL CONFIGURATION
    The global configuration directory has to be writable by the user the
    program is running-as. One way to do this is to make the directory
    world-writable. Hopefully a better solution will be implemented in the
    future.

   UNIX-like systems. (Linux FreeBSD OpenBSD NetBSD)
        /etc/plconf

   Mac OS X / Darwin
